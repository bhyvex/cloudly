									Reserved instances are an Amazon EC2 feature that allows you to
								    purchase reserved server capacity up to 3 years in advance.</p>

								    <p>In exchange the hourly usage rate is heavily discounted and server capacity is
								    guaranteed to be available when you need it.</p>

								    <h2>3 types of reservation: Light, Medium and Heavy Utilization</h2>

								    <p>Light utilization reservations have the lowest up-front fee and the lowest discount
								    on usage fees. Heavy utilization reservations have the highest up-front fee and the
								    highest discount on usage fees. </p>

								        <h2>How much will I save?</h2>

								        <p>Cloudly provides an interactive cost savings calculator in the
								        reserved instance dialog. For servers that are deployed full-time you
								        can save up to 76% of total costs using a <em>Heavy Utilization</em>
								        type reservation. </p>

								        <p>For example, running an X-Large High-RAM server continuously
								        as a standard <em>On-Demand</em> instance vs as a <em>Heavy
								        Utilization</em> type reserved instance:</p>

								        <table class="table table-condensed">
								        <tbody><tr>
								            <th>Cost</th>
								            <th>Unreserved</th>
								            <th>Reserved for 1 year</th>
								            <th>Reserved for 3 years</th>
								        </tr>
								        <tr>
								            <th>Up front fee</th>
								            <td>$0</td>
								            <td>$789</td>
								            <td>$1,198</td>
								        </tr>
								        <tr>
								            <th>Hourly rate</th>
								            <td>$0.41</td>

								            <td>$0.053</td>
								        </tr>
								        <tr>
								            <th>Monthly cost</th>
								            <td>$295</td>
								            <td>$49</td>
								            <td>$38</td>
								        </tr>
								        <tr>
								            <th>1 year</th>
								            <td>$3,540 ($295 x 12)</td>
								            <td>$1,377 ($789 + $49 x 12)</td>
								            <td>$855 ($1,198/3 + $38 x 12)</td>
								        </tr>

								        <tr>
								            <th>3 years</th>
								            <td>$10,620 ($3,540 x 3)</td>
								            <td>$4,131 ($1,377  x 3)</td>
								            <td>$2,565 ($855 x 3)</td>
								        </tr>

								        <tr class="last">
								            <th>Total savings</th>
								            <td>$0</td>
								            <td>$2,166/year (61%)</td>
								            <td>$8,055/3 years (76%)</td>
								        </tr>

								        </tbody></table>

										<br/>

								        <p>Similar relative cost savings are available for other server sizes.
								        In principle, the larger the instance size, the larger the discount.</p>

								        <h2>Does reserving capacity obligate me to run a server full time?</h2>

								        <p>No. At any time you can further reduce costs by shutting down unused
								        instances.</p>

								        <h2>Can I still save money if I don't run a server full time?</h2>

								        <p>Yes. Cloudly helps you calculate the minimum utilization level (I.e.,
								        percentage of time an instance is run) required for reserving an
								        instance to save you money.</p>

								        <p>For example, an <em>X-Large High-RAM</em> instance reserved for 3
								        years at <em>Light Utilization</em> breaks even at just 5% utilization,
								        while <em>Heavy Utilization</em> breaks even at 12% utilization.  So if
								        in the next 3 years you use that type of instance for at least two
								        months total then purchasing a reserved instance would be a good
								        idea.</p>

								        <p><em>Medium</em> and <em>Heavy utilization</em> type reserved
								        instances break even at higher utilization levels than <em>Light
								        Utilization</em> type reserved instances but provide greater total cost
								        savings for continuously running servers.</p>

								        <h2>How exactly does this work?</h2>

								        <p>Through Cloudly you can purchase a reserved instance of a specific
								        size in a specific region for a specific time period and utilization
								        level. Cloudly reservation dialog will show you the up-front fee, new
								        hourly fee, break-even utilization level and expected cost savings for
								        a continuously run server.</p>

								        <p>Amazon bills you a non-refundable one-time fee for the purchase. Once
								        the process is complete Cloudly automatically applies the discounted
								        hourly rate to any matching server. You'll see this reflected in the
								        server dashboard.</p>

								        <h2>Are the reduced usage fees attached to a specific server?</h2>

								        <p>You don't have to worry about that. Reserved instances are a
								        property of the billing system, not your cloud servers. For example,
								        if you shut down an old server and start a new one in the same
								        region the reserved pricing will apply to the new server
								        automatically.</p>

						  <p><font size=5>Security Security is a major major thing.</font></p>
	                        <p class="lead">
									Security is why you've chosen a private cloud solution in the first place.
									<br/>
									<h3>Automatic Security Updates</h3>

									<p><span>TurnKey installs the latest security updates over the network for you:</span></p>

									<ol>
										<li>The first time you boot a new appliance deployment (you can choose to skip this)</li>
										<li>Every night, around 4 AM.</li>
									</ol>

									<p>Usually automatically updating software is considered to be a risky practice since updates may occasionally break existing functionality (e.g., changes to file formats, software interfaces, or expected behavior).</p>

									<p>Debian mitigate this risk by <a href="http://www.debian.org/security/faq#version" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">carefully backporting security fixes</a> so that security updates change as little as possible, minimizing the likelyhood that things will break.</p>

									<p>In practice we've found it is very rare for a security update to break something, so we believe it is beneficial to&nbsp; configure software appliances to auto-update security fixes by default. Advanced users can always disable this mechanism and apply security fixes manually if they want.</p>

									<h3>Installing security updates</h3>
									<p>In a root shell, run the following command:</p>

									<pre>install-security-updates</pre>
									<h5>Caution: This isn't 100% full-proof. Make sure we can reach you.</h5>
									<p>Unfortunately, we can't fix everything automatically so it's still very important that we be able to contact you when necessary.<br>
									<br>
									Otherwise you may not know that a problem requires your attention until it's too late. Sure, thanks to automatic security updates we <em>usually</em> don't need to bother you regarding security issues, but there are occasional exceptions...</p>

									<ol>
										<li><strong>Not everything can be updated automatically</strong>: automatic security updates only work for supported software that is maintained using the package management system. Not all software is installed through the package management system. Not all software installed through the package management is supported.&nbsp; See the limitations section below for details.<br>
										&nbsp;</li>
										<li><strong>Some bugs can break automatic updates</strong>: even though security updates change as little as possible and are exceptionally well tested, mistakes can still happen. Usually these can be caught and fixed with another automatic update, but manual intervention is still required for bugs that break the auto-updates mechanism or one of its dependencies.</li>
									</ol>

									<h4>How it works</h4>
									<p>Users who wish to tweak the auto-update mechanism may find it helpful to understand how it is set up.</p>

									<p>1) A cron job is configured to run <em>cron-apt</em> daily.<em> </em></p>

<pre>
	$ cat /etc/cron.d/cron-apt
	# Regular cron jobs for the cron-apt package
	# Every night at 4 o'clock.
	0 4     * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/cron-apt &amp;&amp; /usr/sbin/cron-apt
</pre>

		<p>2)<em> cron-apt</em> is configured to only update from the security sources list.</p>

<pre>
	$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/security.sources.list
	deb <a href="http://archive.turnkeylinux.org/ubuntu" title="http://archive.turnkeylinux.org/ubuntu" rel="nofollow">http://archive.turnkeylinux.org/ubuntu</a> lucid-security main
	deb <a href="http://archive.turnkeylinux.org/ubuntu" title="http://archive.turnkeylinux.org/ubuntu" rel="nofollow">http://archive.turnkeylinux.org/ubuntu</a> lucid-security universe
	deb <a href="http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu" title="http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu" rel="nofollow">http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu</a> lucid-security main
	deb <a href="http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu" title="http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu" rel="nofollow">http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu</a> lucid-security universe
</pre>

									<p>3)<em> cron-apt</em> is configured to install the updates automatically:</p>

<pre>
	$ cat /etc/cron-apt/action.d/5-install
	autoclean -q -y
	dist-upgrade -q -y -o APT::Get::Show-Upgraded=true \
	-o Dir::Etc::sourcelist=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/security.sources.list \
	-o Dir::Etc::sourceparts=nonexistent \
	-o DPkg::Options::=--force-confdef \
	-o DPkg::Options::=--force-confold
</pre>

									<p>4) <em>cron-apt</em> logs to <em>/var/log/cron-apt/log</em></p>

									<h4>Installing security updates on-demand</h4>

									<p>You can invoke the cron-apt script described above from the command line at any time (e.g., you don't feel like waiting for the nightly security updates cron job):</p>

<pre>
	/usr/sbin/cron-apt
</pre>

									<h4>Limitations</h4>

									<p>TurnKey Linux 11 is based on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid), a Long Term Support release for which Canonical (Ubuntu's sponsor) has guaranteed free security updates until April 2015.</p>

									<p>This guarantee is limited to packages in the "<em>main</em>" component of the Ubuntu package repositories, comprising roughly 7000 of the most important packages and provide good coverage for the core operating system.</p>

									<p>However, Canonical's Long Term Support guarantee does not apply to:</p>

									<ul>
										<li><strong>Non-main packages</strong>: packages in non-main components of the Ubuntu repositories (e.g., "<em>universe</em>" and "<em>multiverse</em>") are not guaranteed by Canonical, though updates to non-main packages may still be provided by the Ubuntu community.<br>
										<br>
										When required and when there are no better alternatives, a TurnKey appliance may contain non-main packages. Usually this is for software with low security sensitivity.<br>
										&nbsp;</li>
										<li><strong>TurnKey Linux custom packages</strong>: TurnKey contains a few custom packages which are updated directly by the Core developers from the project's cryptographically signed <a href="http://archive.turnkeylinux.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">package repository</a>.<br>
										&nbsp;</li>
										<li><strong>Software installed from source code</strong>: unfortunately, many of the most popular open source web applications (e.g., Joomla) are not packaged by Ubuntu or Debian. This means that they have to be installed and maintained by hand directly from upstream source code and no automatic security updates can be provided through the package management system.<br>
										<br>
										Fortunately, most web applications run with reduced privileges and are developed in high-level programming languages that are less susceptible to many of the most serious low-level security vulnerabilities. Also in the appliance model, each application is confined to its own virtual machine. This limits the potential damage somewhat but vigilance is still recommended, especially for high-risk usage scenarios.<br>
										<br>
										When a TurnKey appliance includes software installed from upstream source code, this is usually the first thing documented on the appliance page.</li>
									</ul>

									<p>You can use the "apt-cache policy" command to determine a package's origin:</p>

<pre>
	$ apt-cache policy openssh-server
	openssh-server:
	Installed: 1:5.3p1-3ubuntu4
	Candidate: 1:5.3p1-3ubuntu4
	Version table:
	*** 1:5.3p1-3ubuntu4
	650 <a href="http://archive.ubuntu.com" title="http://archive.ubuntu.com" rel="nofollow">http://archive.ubuntu.com</a> lucid-security/main Packages
</pre>

									<p>So in the case of openssh-server, we have the most recent version installed and are receiving updates automatically from the lucid-security repository.</p>
